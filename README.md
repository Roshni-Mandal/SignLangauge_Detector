## Description
The goal of this project is to develop a sign language detection system that can recognize sign language gestures in real-time and translate them into text or speech. Sign language is used by deaf and hard-of-hearing people to communicate, but many people who do not use sign language have difficulty understanding it. By developing a sign language detection system, we can bridge this communication gap and improve accessibility for people with hearing disabilities.
